This is the code u can run and see in the console - https://github.com/Harsha-Vardhan-Tangudu/Online-Learning-Platform-Using-Hybrid-Structures/blob/main/dsa%20project.py


To extend our project to link with an UI.You should install some of libraries related to flask.
after that,
If u run any of the page in the folder flask pro u will get in console a URL.This will take to a our UI Page
